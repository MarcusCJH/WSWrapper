Introduction
------------

I create this application for the sole purpose for a web socket wrapper for myself. 
Because I am lazy to type in "java.exe -jar xxxx.jar". That's why I created this. 
It is actually for the use of my other project that usees web socket. 

Features
--------

* File Directory Browser - Must Search for ".jar" only.
* Lock the File before starting the wrapper.
* Basic Function, start, restart and disconnecting
